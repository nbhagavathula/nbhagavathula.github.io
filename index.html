          <h2 class="mb-5">Personal Statement</h2>
          <p lass="mb-0">
            I take teaching as a source of pleasure as it keeps extending the
            horizon of my knowledge. A good teacher takes her job as a challenge
            and has to constantly innovate to better her methods. Over the years
            I have brought forth many innovative methods and have enjoyed
            watching my methods work. I have especially been striving in shaping
            students who later on become assets to the society.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            My experience has given me the valuable insight that teaching is
            more than mere classroom instruction. I effort to concentrate more
            on motivating the child towards learning the subject with interest
            and understanding the concepts thoroughly. I believe in imparting
            value education to students, and trained myself to do the same via
            attending multiple seminars and workshops on value-education.
            Mathematics, the queen of sciences and the subject I teach the most,
            imparts values - life skills, practical values, moral values,
            cultural values, disciplinary values etc. Every math concept can be
            taught by correlating it with a value. Teaching in such a way molds
            the child in to a positive-minded person with improved confidence
            and self-esteem.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Students will learn that Mathematics with its interrelated topics
            like Algebra, Arithmetic, Trigonometry, Statistics, Geometry,
            Calculus etc. make our day to day life very easy.Having done courses
            in <i> Adult Psychology</i> and <i> Child Psychology </i> as part of
            the curriculum in my B.Ed, as well as being a volunteer
            psychological counsellor I have been successful in motivating
            children to take active part in their studies and to take tests
            without any fear. Through giving importance to value-oriented
            teaching, I wish to help students in developing a strong character,
            help them to avoid some of the bad habits that students develop
            because of inability to handle doubts and fears caused by the
            uncertainties of life.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-3">
            The difference between an intelligent and a "below-average" student
            is just the amount of time spent on practicing problems; the gap can
            be closed effectively by making Math, Physics and Chemistry problems
            enjoyable in solving and thus not alienating students of any
            background or ability. I strive to bring out the talent every child
            has within, at the same time taking care that the child is not
            carried away by his/her own ability. I feel always "Down to Earth"
            mentality makes a person humble and a good citizen.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-3">
            Often, I observe students just thinking about the operation or
            formula to get a correct answer but in my view arriving at the
            correct answer is not as important as the approach to solve it. One
            should have the will and zeal to analyze the question from different
            angles and the determination not to give up. In the
            <i> Bhagavad Gita </i> Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to put all your
            efforts without thinking of the result, even before you start your
            venture. A genuine approach gives a genuine result. Persistence and
            patience along with character development is what I strive to bring
            to the table whilst teaching.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            My innovative teaching fetched me multiple prizes and awards during
            various high school science fairs and student congresses. I received
            the Andhra Pradesh State first prize for "Innovative teaching using
            low-cost teaching aids" in 1994. I bagged the best teacher award
            during my B.Ed year in 1988. I also received a commendation letter
            from Kanchi peetham.
