          <p lass="mb-0">
            My experience as a teacher has given me the valuable insight that
            teaching is more than just mere classroom instruction. I take
            teaching as a source of pleasure as it keeps extending the horizon
            of my knowledge. A good teacher takes her job as a challenge and has
            to constantly innovate to better her methods. Over the years I have
            brought forth many innovative methods and have enjoyed watching my
            methods work. I’ve especially been striving in shaping students who
            later on become assets to the society.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Being a volunteer psychological counsellor I concentrate more on
            motivating the child towards learning the subject with interest and
            understand the concept thoroughly. I believe in imparting value
            education to students, and I trained myself to do the same via
            attending multiple seminars and workshops on value-education.
            Mathematics, the queen of sciences, teaches us values, life skills
            practical values, moral values, cultural values, disciplinary values
            etc. Through my mathematics lessons, the child will be moulded into
            a positive-minded, self-confident person with much-needed
            self-esteem. They will learn that Mathematics with its interrelated
            topics like Algebra, Arithmetic, Trigonometry, Statistics, Geometry,
            Calculus etc make our day to day life very easy.Having done courses
            in Adult Psychology and Child Psychology as part of the curriculum
            in my B.Ed, I have been trying to motivate the children to show
            interest in studies and take the tests without any fear.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-0">
            My experience has taught me that the difference between an
            intelligent and a "below-average" student is just the amount of time
            spent on practising problems; the gap can be closed effectively by
            making Math, Physics and Chemistry problems enjoyable in solving,
            thus, not alienating students of any background or ability. I strive
            to bring out the inner talent every child has within, at the same
            time taking care that the child is not carried away by his/her own
            ability. I feel always "Down to Earth" mentality makes a person
            humble and a good citizen. All through my career, I've been regarded
            as a very innovative teacher - employing novel methods and kits
            which have fetched me awards.
